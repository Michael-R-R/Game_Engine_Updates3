# Game_Engine_Updates3
Part 3 of my graphics engine updates. Repo for updating and showcasing new features in my graphics engine. Source code remains private. This project is mainly for education purposes. Any graphics engine names are just place holders.

### UPDATE_11:
- UI design overhaul, inspired by my other project: https://github.com/Michael-R-R/GW2_Tool_Hub
- First primitive game object implemented, the cube.
- Redesigned the class for adding game object settings to be more readable and friendly
- Object color picker implemented
